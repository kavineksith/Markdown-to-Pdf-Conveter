## Markdown to PDF Converter Documentation

### Overview:
This Python script converts a Markdown file to a styled PDF. The script:
1. Reads a Markdown file provided as input.
2. Converts the Markdown content to HTML.
3. Applies custom CSS styles for layout and formatting.
4. Converts the styled HTML to a PDF and saves it to the specified output path.
5. Logs all actions and errors to a log file.
6. Accepts command-line arguments for the input Markdown file and the output PDF file.

### Features:
- **CSS Styling**: The script applies predefined CSS for the PDF layout (e.g., margins, font styles, page size).
- **Logging**: Logs the execution process, including successes and errors, to both a log file and the console.
- **Command-Line Arguments**: Uses `sys.argv` to allow users to provide input and output file paths via the command line.

---

### Requirements:

1. **Python 3.x**: The script is written in Python 3.x.
2. **Required Python Libraries**:
   - `markdown`: To convert Markdown to HTML.
   - `pdfkit`: To convert HTML to PDF.
   - `logging`: For logging events.
   - `sys`: To handle command-line arguments.
   - `os`: To check for file existence.
   
   Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install markdown pdfkit
   ```

3. **External Dependency**:
   - `wkhtmltopdf`: `pdfkit` depends on `wkhtmltopdf` to generate PDFs from HTML. Make sure it's installed:
     - On macOS: `brew install wkhtmltopdf`
     - On Linux: `sudo apt install wkhtmltopdf`
     - On Windows: [Download wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)

### Script Usage:

1. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   The script accepts two command-line arguments:
   - **Input Markdown File**: Path to the Markdown file to be converted.
   - **Output PDF File**: Path to save the generated PDF.

   Example:
   ```bash
   python markdown_to_pdf.py input.md output.pdf
   ```

   Where:
   - `input.md` is the Markdown file.
   - `output.pdf` is the generated PDF.

2. **Log File**:
   - The script creates a log file named `conversion_log.log` in the same directory as the script.
   - Logs include timestamps, actions (e.g., file opened, conversion started), and error messages.

---

### Script Structure:

#### 1. **MarkdownToPDFConversionError (Custom Exception)**:
   - A custom exception class used to handle errors during the conversion process.
   - Provides a meaningful error message when an error occurs (e.g., file not found, conversion failure).

#### 2. **MarkdownToPDFConverter Class**:
   This class encapsulates the process of converting a Markdown file to PDF:
   - **`__init__(self, markdown_file, output_pdf_path)`**: Initializes the converter with the input Markdown file and output PDF path.
   - **`read_markdown(self)`**: Reads the content of the Markdown file and returns it as a string. If the file doesn't exist, raises a `MarkdownToPDFConversionError`.
   - **`convert_to_html(self, markdown_text)`**: Converts the Markdown content to HTML.
   - **`apply_css_styles(self, html_content)`**: Applies predefined CSS styles to the HTML content (margins, font styles, page layout).
   - **`convert_to_pdf(self, html_content)`**: Converts the styled HTML content into a PDF and saves it to the specified output path. If the conversion fails, raises a `MarkdownToPDFConversionError`.
   - **`process_conversion(self)`**: Orchestrates the entire conversion process: reading the Markdown, converting to HTML, applying CSS, and generating the PDF.

#### 3. **Logging**:
   - The script uses Python's built-in `logging` module to log events and errors.
   - Logs both to the console and to a log file (`conversion_log.log`).
   - Log levels include `INFO` for normal actions and `ERROR` for issues encountered during the process.

#### 4. **Command-Line Arguments (sys.argv)**:
   - The script expects two arguments: the input Markdown file path and the output PDF file path.
   - It checks for the correct number of arguments and validates the input file's existence before proceeding.

#### 5. **Main Function**:
   - Configures logging.
   - Handles command-line arguments.
   - Creates an instance of the `MarkdownToPDFConverter` class and calls `process_conversion()` to perform the conversion.

### Logging Details:

- **Log File**: `conversion_log.log`
   - **INFO logs**: Include successful steps like file opening, HTML conversion, and PDF creation.
   - **ERROR logs**: Include issues such as file reading errors, conversion failures, or missing dependencies.

   Example log entry:
   ```
   2025-01-26 12:34:56,789 - INFO - Successfully opened Markdown file: input.md
   2025-01-26 12:34:56,790 - INFO - Converting Markdown to HTML.
   2025-01-26 12:34:56,791 - INFO - Applying CSS styles to HTML.
   2025-01-26 12:34:56,792 - INFO - Converting HTML to PDF: output.pdf
   2025-01-26 12:34:56,794 - INFO - PDF successfully created at output.pdf
   ```

---

### Error Handling:

- **File Not Found**: If the Markdown file doesn't exist or cannot be opened, a `MarkdownToPDFConversionError` is raised and logged, and the program exits with an error code.
  
- **PDF Generation Failure**: If the PDF generation fails (e.g., `wkhtmltopdf` is not properly installed), a `MarkdownToPDFConversionError` is raised and logged.

---

### Example:

1. **Create a Markdown file** (e.g., `input.md`):
   ```markdown
   # Sample Markdown Document

   This is a simple markdown to PDF conversion example.

   ## Features

   - Convert markdown to HTML
   - Convert HTML to PDF
   - Customize PDF layout with A4 size and margins

   ## Conclusion

   This demonstrates how you can adjust PDF layout using Python and CSS.
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python markdown_to_pdf.py input.md output.pdf
   ```

3. **Check the Log File** (`conversion_log.log`):
   The log file will contain details of the conversion process, including any errors encountered.

### Conclusion:

This script provides a flexible and automated way to convert Markdown files to PDF while applying custom styling. It offers robust error handling, logging, and command-line interface support, making it suitable for both individual and batch processing scenarios.
